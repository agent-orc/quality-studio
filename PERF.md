# Quality Studio performance record

## QS-5 hierarchy scan budget

Measured 2026-07-22 on Linux 6.8, .NET 10.0.9, Intel Core i7-8700
(12 logical CPUs), 62 GiB RAM. The corpus was a generic repository containing
5,000 one-line files in one source directory. The command used the Debug build:

```text
dotnet run --project src/quality/quality.csproj --no-build -- scan <fixture>
event=quality.scan.completed projects=1 modules=1 elapsedMs=165
```

The 165 ms result includes hierarchy derivation and review-meta discovery, but
not fixture creation. A regression test independently asserts that all 5,000
files are present and that hierarchy derivation completes within 5 seconds on
the test host. Warm API requests reuse the snapshot while the Git state is
unchanged.

## QS-54 real repository switching

Measured 2026-08-08 on Linux 6.8, .NET 10.0.301, Intel Core i7-8700
(12 logical CPUs). Unlike the QS-40 browser fixture, these requests used the
real API against two existing repositories and included hierarchy derivation,
Git state, review-meta discovery, and the project projection.

| Repository | Tracked files | State | Git status | Hierarchy scan | Review-meta discovery | Projection | Total |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| quality-studio (`0d03986`) | 135 | cold, before | 21.58 ms | 743.20 ms | 9.01 ms | 99.25 ms | 874.90 ms |
| quality-studio (`0d03986`) | 135 | warm, before | 5.49 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms | 5.52 ms |
| agent-taskboard (`32bf8983`) | 3,450 | cold, before | 45.78 ms | 8,272.84 ms | 45.25 ms | 1,418.01 ms | 9,781.93 ms |
| agent-taskboard (`32bf8983`) | 3,450 | warm, before | 17.57 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms | 17.60 ms |
| quality-studio (`0d03986`) | 135 | cold prewarm, after | 36.16 ms | 970.54 ms | 12.51 ms | 176.90 ms | 1,198.15 ms |
| quality-studio (`0d03986`) | 135 | operator request after prewarm | 5.23 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms | 5.30 ms |
| agent-taskboard (`32bf8983`) | 3,450 | cold prewarm, after | 34.00 ms | 9,773.52 ms | 46.81 ms | 1,312.63 ms | 11,167.07 ms |
| agent-taskboard (`32bf8983`) | 3,450 | operator request after prewarm | 17.30 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms | 18.00 ms |

The hierarchy scan is the dominant cold phase: 85% of quality-studio's cold
request and 84.6% of agent-taskboard's. Projection is the second largest block
for agent-taskboard at 14.5%. The smallest measured intervention is therefore
to populate the existing immutable hierarchy and projection caches in a
background hosted service for every registered repository. It deliberately
does not add a second cache or weaken Git-state invalidation. Cold work remains
visible in `qs.repository.prewarm`, but it is removed from the operator's
switch request.

The complete warm switch fan-out exposed a separate ancillary cost:
agent-taskboard's guideline/trace response took 3,169.8 ms while the warm
project response took 65.8 ms. Scan, input, guideline, risk, review-run, and
usage projections now refresh after the dashboard and tree are usable. A real
project-plus-tree run for agent-taskboard measured 219.5–295.8 ms after prewarm.

The API emits a stable JSON event named `qs.repository.switch.backend` with
`repositoryId`, `cache`, `durationMs`, `fileCount`, and a `phases` object
containing `gitStatusMs`, `cacheWaitMs`, `scanMs`,
`reviewMetaDiscoveryMs`, and `projectionMs`. The same phases are exposed in
the standard `Server-Timing` response header. Background measurements use the
same shape in `qs.repository.prewarm`.

The browser contract is `< 100 ms` to a visible transition and `< 500 ms` to a
usable dashboard and tree. The 500 ms bound gives measured headroom above the
295.8 ms real large-repository run while remaining far below the previous
multi-second path. See `frontend/PERF.md` for the reproducible browser harness.

## QS-78 warm re-switch confirmation

Re-measured 2026-08-24 on Linux 6.8, .NET 10.0.301, Release build, against a
real API serving this repository (324 tracked files). The project and tree
requests were issued serially so each phase is attributed to the request that
paid for it.

| State | Project response | Git status | Hierarchy scan | Review-meta discovery | Projection |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| cold, after a real working-tree change | 1,650.32 ms | 21.99 ms | 1,154.15 ms | 46.28 ms | 354.94 ms |
| warm, re-switch at the same Git state | 18.03–33.55 ms | 12.22–24.73 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms |
| cold, after reverting that change | 1,209.60 ms | 13.14 ms | 1,037.87 ms | 92.10 ms | 0 ms |

A warm re-switch is 49–91× cheaper than the cold path, and the two phases that
dominate it cost exactly zero. What remains is the Git-state probe that decides
whether the cache is still valid. As the shell issues both calls in parallel,
the operator's warm switch measured 62.4–78.5 ms end to end against 1,618.0 ms
cold.

Adding one untracked file moved the project ETag and forced a full rescan;
removing it again returned the ETag to its original value, so invalidation is
keyed by repository content rather than bumped on every request. On that revert
the projection phase cost 0 ms because its cache is keyed by the same Git state
and the pre-change entry was still resident.
`ApiSmokeTests.Project_reuses_the_scan_and_projection_caches_on_a_warm_repeat_switch`
guards the warm path at the HTTP level with an unconditional repeat request, so
a regression cannot hide behind a 304.
