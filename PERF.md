# Quality Studio performance record

## QS-95 boundary inventory scaling

Measured 2026-08-26 on the task host with .NET SDK 10.0.301 and runtime 10.0.9
against the real Agent Studio checkout at `/home/agent/runner-work/repo`
(`94b03d2`, 3,337 tracked files and 1,773 sensor-eligible files). The old sensor
timed out after 20.00 seconds while consuming 20.01 seconds of user CPU and
producing no result. Source profiling identified two multiplicative scans:
host reachability traversed the whole corpus for each server endpoint, while
consumer discovery split and regex-scanned every JavaScript/TypeScript line for
each endpoint. MVC controller discovery also used a backtracking expression.

Controller discovery is now non-backtracking. Browser client calls are indexed
once by method and route token, and host reachability is derived once per scan.
The optimized real-repository verification completes in 2.23 seconds wall time
(2.61 seconds user CPU), producing 583 boundary entries and 917 mechanical
findings. It honestly reports 1,772 of 1,773 files analyzed because one
19,050,559-byte HTML artifact exceeds the 2 MiB source limit. A bounded 100-file
page completes in 0.47 seconds and its next incremental page in 0.44 seconds.
All three partial results name their omission reasons, do not replace repository
truth, and exit with code 2.

A regression fixture creates 1,500 source files, 800 server routes, and 1,499
matching client calls. It verifies consumer joins and full coverage under a
10-second host budget, then verifies bounded and continuation-page coverage
metadata. The fixture completed in 0.762 seconds in the focused test run.

Quality Studio's remote has no `develop` ref as of this measurement; its remote
default is `main`. The delivery branch was therefore rebased onto the fresh
`origin/main` tip (`e31089c`) before the QS-95 salvage was reapplied.

## QS-5 hierarchy scan budget

Measured 2026-07-22 on Linux 6.8, .NET 10.0.9, Intel Core i7-8700
(12 logical CPUs), 62 GiB RAM. The corpus was a generic repository containing
5,000 one-line files in one source directory. The command used the Debug build:

```text
dotnet run --project src/quality/quality.csproj --no-build -- scan <fixture>
event=quality.scan.completed projects=1 modules=1 elapsedMs=165
```

The 165 ms result includes hierarchy derivation and review-meta discovery, but
not fixture creation. A regression test independently asserts that all 5,000
files are present and that hierarchy derivation completes within 5 seconds on
the test host. Warm API requests reuse the snapshot while the Git state is
unchanged.

## QS-54 real repository switching

Measured 2026-08-08 on Linux 6.8, .NET 10.0.301, Intel Core i7-8700
(12 logical CPUs). Unlike the QS-40 browser fixture, these requests used the
real API against two existing repositories and included hierarchy derivation,
Git state, review-meta discovery, and the project projection.

| Repository | Tracked files | State | Git status | Hierarchy scan | Review-meta discovery | Projection | Total |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| quality-studio (`0d03986`) | 135 | cold, before | 21.58 ms | 743.20 ms | 9.01 ms | 99.25 ms | 874.90 ms |
| quality-studio (`0d03986`) | 135 | warm, before | 5.49 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms | 5.52 ms |
| agent-taskboard (`32bf8983`) | 3,450 | cold, before | 45.78 ms | 8,272.84 ms | 45.25 ms | 1,418.01 ms | 9,781.93 ms |
| agent-taskboard (`32bf8983`) | 3,450 | warm, before | 17.57 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms | 17.60 ms |
| quality-studio (`0d03986`) | 135 | cold prewarm, after | 36.16 ms | 970.54 ms | 12.51 ms | 176.90 ms | 1,198.15 ms |
| quality-studio (`0d03986`) | 135 | operator request after prewarm | 5.23 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms | 5.30 ms |
| agent-taskboard (`32bf8983`) | 3,450 | cold prewarm, after | 34.00 ms | 9,773.52 ms | 46.81 ms | 1,312.63 ms | 11,167.07 ms |
| agent-taskboard (`32bf8983`) | 3,450 | operator request after prewarm | 17.30 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms | 0 ms | 18.00 ms |

The hierarchy scan is the dominant cold phase: 85% of quality-studio's cold
request and 84.6% of agent-taskboard's. Projection is the second largest block
for agent-taskboard at 14.5%. The smallest measured intervention is therefore
to populate the existing immutable hierarchy and projection caches in a
background hosted service for every registered repository. It deliberately
does not add a second cache or weaken Git-state invalidation. Cold work remains
visible in `qs.repository.prewarm`, but it is removed from the operator's
switch request.

The complete warm switch fan-out exposed a separate ancillary cost:
agent-taskboard's guideline/trace response took 3,169.8 ms while the warm
project response took 65.8 ms. Scan, input, guideline, risk, review-run, and
usage projections now refresh after the dashboard and tree are usable. A real
project-plus-tree run for agent-taskboard measured 219.5–295.8 ms after prewarm.

The API emits a stable JSON event named `qs.repository.switch.backend` with
`repositoryId`, `cache`, `durationMs`, `fileCount`, and a `phases` object
containing `gitStatusMs`, `cacheWaitMs`, `scanMs`,
`reviewMetaDiscoveryMs`, and `projectionMs`. The same phases are exposed in
the standard `Server-Timing` response header. Background measurements use the
same shape in `qs.repository.prewarm`.

The browser contract is `< 100 ms` to a visible transition and `< 500 ms` to a
usable dashboard and tree. The 500 ms bound gives measured headroom above the
295.8 ms real large-repository run while remaining far below the previous
multi-second path. See `frontend/PERF.md` for the reproducible browser harness.
